install the cude support python module i.e numba and also install numpy sklearn
(use NVDIA graphic card present computer)

For comparition of cuda with opencl we have also implemented in opencl 
(just for comparing the performance)

install opencl support module i.e pyopencl

we have also given the sequential code to test the performance

we use "Copy of Eyes.csv" dataset to test the accuracy of neural network

To run cuda/Opencl code 

python3 <program_file.py>
