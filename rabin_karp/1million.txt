"In the picture above we are finding occurrences starting from position 4, but there is a mismatch at position 12. Before getting a mismatch we have already matched the string HACKHACK, and the largest proper prefix that is also a proper suffix (border) of HACKHACK is HACK, so we should start finding occurrences again from position 8 and taking into account that all characters from 8 to 11 are already matched. It turns out that there is an occurrence starting at position 8, so all characters of the pattern have matched, since HACKHACKIT does not have any border, then we start finding occurrences again starting from position 18.
According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.

According to the previous analysis we need to know for each i, the the largest border of P[0...i]. Let f[i] be the length of the largest border of P[0...i]. Function f is known as failure function, because it says from where start if we find a mismatch.
How can we calculate f[i] efficiently? One approach is to think in an inductive way: suppose that we have already calculated the function f for for all indices less than i. Using that information how can we calculate f[i]?Given a text T we are interested in calculating all the occurrences of a pattern P.
This simple problem has a lot of applications. For example, the text can be the nucleotide sequence of the human DNA and the pattern a genomic sequence of some genetic disease, or the text can be all the internet, and the pattern a query (the Google problem), etc.
We are going to study the exact string matching problem, that is given two strings T and P we want to find all substrings of T that are equal to P. Formally, we want to calculate all indices i such that T[i+s] = P[s] for each 0 ≤ s ≤ |P|-1.
In the following example, you are given a string T and a pattern P, and all the occurrences of P in T are highlighted in red.Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be-
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text. Let us first understand how two independent approaches work together in the Boyer Moore algorithm. If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics. At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics. So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step.
Unlike the previous pattern searching algorithms, Boyer Moore algorithm starts matching from the last character of the pattern.In the picture above we are finding occurrences starting from position 4, but there is a mismatch at position 12. Before getting a mismatch we have alre"1024000
